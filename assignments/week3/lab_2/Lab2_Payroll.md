# Lab 2: Payroll  
> Due Tuesday by 11:59pm  
> Points 16  
> Submitting a text entry box or a file upload  
> Available Apr 6 at 12am - Apr 27 at 11:59pm 22 days  

> ## You will uploading your lab in Canvas as a .java attachment.  
> 
> You may work with one or two other students on this lab if you'd like.  Please submit one lab per team.  Make sure that you include your name and the names of your team members.  Each student is required to turn in their own pre-lab and post-lab.  You should name your file <first initial><last initial>Payroll.java and will be turning in your lab by to me by e-mail using Canvas Inbox.  
> 
> Your second program will require the use of different print statements that you learned from the first lab.  You will also use primitive and String types, comparison of primitive types, along with if/else and whiles loops.  You will have the opportunity to take a problem, and break it down into an algorithm, with the use of pseudo-code.   
>  
> For your second program, you will create an interactive payroll program.  You will prompt the user for hours worked, pay-rate, whether they're hourly or salaried.  From that, you will calculate their gross and net pay.  On top of that, your program will calculate this each time for n users, defending on the size of the company,  Sounds like a great place to use a constant.  
>  
> I know that the authors of your book like to use global variables and constants, (aka class constants/variables).  Please don't use them.  It's very poor programming practice and is rarely used out in industry.  All the companies that I know of forbid their employees from using them.  One the reasons that we have Object Oriented programming is so that we don't need to use globals.  
>  
> For full credit, please use 1) comments (in the header, methods, and any complex code), 2) proper formatting and indentation, 3) proper style, and finally 4)  ensure that the code executes properly.  This assignment is worth 16 points instead of the normal 20 points.  
>  
> As always, the use of printf, nested if/else statements, and very well written and/or creatively done code will result in extra credit.  
>  
> Happy programming and let me know if you have any questions.  Don't forget to use the de-bugger.
