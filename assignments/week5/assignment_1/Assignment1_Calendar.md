<center>Calendar Assignment</center>
<center>Part 1</center>

# Key topics:
> Printing, data types, methods, operators, expressions, variables, for loops, class constants, parameters, returns, String objects, Scanner objects

# Learning Outcomes:
> - Begin to become familiar with setup, design, execution and testing of basic Java programs
> - Design and develop a multi-method program in good style
> - Demonstrate the ability to decompose a problem and reduce redundancy using methods
> - Apply tools and techniques introduced in class to form a workingprogram
> \
> By the end of this assignment, you should be familiar with the material covered in class so far and be able to demonstrate the ability to use it properly in practice.

# Task:
> Your task is to create a basic calendar using Java. Over the course of the quarter, we will be
> adding to this very basic calendar to make it more functional and robust. For this part, you will
> be drawing the calendar to the console.
> \
> The calendar’s size should be scalable using class constants. You have some creative freedom
> with designingthe calendar. What characters you use for the outline of the calendar and where
> you place the date in each calendar cell is up to you. An example of what a calendar might look
> like with a size of 10 after completing this assignment is on thenext page.

# Functional Rundown:
> Upon executing your program, the console should ask what date you would like to look at, as
> seen in the example below. The usershould be able to input a date. The month of that date
> should be displayed at the top of the calendar. The month and day input by the user should be
> broken up and displayed at the bottom of the calendar as shown below.
> \
> After asking the user for a date and printing the calendar for that date, your program should print
> a calendar for today’s date followed by the month and day broken up.
> \
> Ultimately, after execution, your calendar should display a prompt to get a date from the user, a
> calendar for that month from the user input, the month and day input by the user broken up, a
> second calendar for the current month, and finally the month and day for the current day broken
> up.For now, you may have every month that the calendar displays have 35 days instead of the
> actual number. We will change that in a later part of the assignment.

# Example Run:

![Calendar 2](https://github.com/frankzappasmustache/CS140_JAVA/blob/main/assignments/week5/assignment_1/calendar2.png)


# Scalability:

> Your program should produce output likethis if the size is 10. However, as stated above, you
> have the freedom to choose what characters you use for the calendar (the “|” and “=” in
> the example above) and the exact location of the number in each cell. Below is an example of a
> calendar produced with a size of 5:
